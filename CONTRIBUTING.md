# Contributing to Sentinel Platform

## Workflow
1. Create an issue (bug/feature) whenever possible
2. Create a branch from `main`
   - `feat/<topic>`, `fix/<topic>`, `chore/<topic>`
3. Open a Pull Request
4. Ensure CI passes and checklist is complete

## Commit convention
We prefer Conventional Commits:
- `feat: ...`
- `fix: ...`
- `docs: ...`
- `chore: ...`

## Code quality
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Add tests for new behavior when applicable
- Consider security and observability (logs/metrics/traces)
